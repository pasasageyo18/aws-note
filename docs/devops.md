# Devops from AWS

## What is Devops?

**Devops** is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.

## Problems with Traditional Development Practices

Traditional ways of developing software have proven slow and inefficient, and fail to support teams' efforts to quickly deliver stable, high-quality applications. Challenges of Waterfall development, monolithic applications, manual processes, and siloed team structures cause bottlenecks and delays.
